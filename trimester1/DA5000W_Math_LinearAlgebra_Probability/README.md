# DA5000W: LinearAlgebra & Probability

## Linear Algebra

**Faculty**: Prof Ramakrishna Pasumarthy

Common unofficial P2P Colab Notebook shared by Samuel (classmate): Linear Algebra: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ka_REmcYf0RYliDglSsrnbkWQXHkfU74#scrollTo=V5HgLa5q9Crh

### IN PROGRESS: Lecture Notes

Each heading here is a title of a lecture PDF. Under that are my notes on it.

#### ALMOST DONE: Introduction: Linear Algebra for Data Science

- Solution types: Consistent (unique, infinite), Inconsistent (no solution)
- Elimination (High school method)
- Graphical Method (plot 2 equation lines, point where they meet is solution)
- **Geometry of Linear Equations**: 3 ways of viewing System of Linear Equations:
    - Matrix Form $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$
        where $A$ is coefficient matrix, $\mathbf{x}$ is vector of unknown variables, $\mathbf{b}$ is vector of RHS values.
    - Row Picture - viewing one equation at a time. Each equation is a line (2D) / plane (3D) / hyperplane (n-D). 2 3D equations/planes meet at a 2D line/equation. In graph common inyeresection is equation solution point(s) if any.
    - Column Picture - view as one vector equation in terms of column vectors of $A$:
If $A = \mathbf{a}_1 \ \mathbf{a}_2 \ \dots \ \mathbf{a}_n$ and x vector has x1, x2 .. xn scalars then:

$$
A x = b \quad \text{translates to} \quad x_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + x_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + \dots + x_n \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{b}.

$$

- *Order of Matrix* is $m \times n$ (rows, columns) - $m$ equations, $n$ unknowns (rectangular matrix). Becomes square matrix if $m = n$.
- *Singular* coefficient matrix is not invertible, so either no (all dont interesect at any common line, though 2 of them might - eg. triangle 3 arms dont interesct at single common point) or infinite solutions (all interesect at common points), depending on RHS $\mathbf{b}$.

**TODO: graphically plot column view** - question came previously in an IIT question paper I think!
