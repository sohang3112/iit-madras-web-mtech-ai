# IIT Madras Web MTech (Industrial AI) 2025
Notes during my Web MTech (AI) at IIT Madras.  Web MTech is an Executive course to be done along with job.
Company MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) or LoS (Letter of Support) is mandatory, otherwise learners can exit with PG Diploma.

Instead of GATE exam scores that are required for admission to regular MTech, 
for web MTech an internal entrance exam of IIT Madras is conducted.
